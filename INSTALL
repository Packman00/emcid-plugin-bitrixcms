Make the Emercoin ID Application:
 - Log in to any Emercoin ID webserver with EMC SSL certificate (such as https://id.emercoin.net)
 - Create the app
 - Use URI as https://YOUR_HOSTNAME/bitrix/tools/oauth/emercoinid.php

Module installation and configuration:
 - Upload 'emercoinid' folder into '/bitrix/modules/' directory of your site
 - Go to Settings -> System settings -> Modules -> Authorization with Emercoin ID, press the 'install' button
 - Go to Settings -> System settings -> Module settings and select 'Authorization with Emercoin ID' in select list
 - Configure the module

After that you can add 'Emercoin ID Authorization' component into any place of your site via visual redactor or adding component code (see below).

<?$APPLICATION->IncludeComponent(
	"emcid:emcid.auth.form",
	"",
	Array()
);?>
